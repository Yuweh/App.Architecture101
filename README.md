Intro To App Architecture

STATUS:
Already using MVC on my projects
Will try to rebuild an App with VIPER and MVVM

iOS APP Architectures:

## MVC
- most used framework in iOS
- bigger apps could populate VC and may cause Massive VC, making it problematic to test

Model 
View 
Controller


## MVVM
-

Model
View
View Model
(View Controller still Present)


## VIPER 
- based from Clean Architecture
- used Singular Responsiblity makes it more equally distributed and testable

View
Inspector
Presentor
Entity
Router
